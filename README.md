Snake_NIC
======================

A snake game that will be able to find the most ways to eat food and lengthen its body using a genetic algorithm.

## How it Works

Just open the app and click on the edit icon. There you can select allergens that the app will be able to recognize in the products and warn you. Then just go back to the main menu and click on the "Scan" button. A screen with a barcode scanner will open. If an allergen is found in the scanned product, the app will let you know about it.

## Why did we develop this project?

Using the example of this game, we want to learn how well the genetic algorithm will influence the behavior of a snake.

## The project team

* Danil Nesterov - responsible for integration genetic algorithm to the snake
* Valeriia Kolesnikova - responsible for basic snake algorithm
* Gleb Lobov - team leader, responsible for documentation and distribution of the tasks
* Andrey Vasiliev  - responsible for integration genetic algorithm to the snake
